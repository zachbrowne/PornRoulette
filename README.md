PornRoulette
============
Google Chrome Extension

PornRoulette is a Google Chrome Extension which opens a new incognito window and searches for porn videos based on most popular keywords in the straight, gay and shemale categories.
Default shortcut is "Alt+X".
If you allow the extension in incognito mode, you'll to be able to refresh the search without having to close the private browsing window each time.

To install it (since it was taken down from the Chrome web store 17 hours after its publication):
- download the extension and unzip it.
- go to the Chrome extensions page and enable the developer mode
- from this same page, click on the "Load Unpacked extension..." button and select the folder in which you unzipped PornRoulette
- #done
